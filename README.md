This CircuitPython sketch shows 4 tabs; Gamma (radiation), Proximity, Delta, and Ship.
Gamma is data pulled from the PocketGeiger from Radiation-watch.com
Proximity is distance data from the Garmin LIDAR Lite 4.0
Delta is from the Adafruit LTR390 UV Light Sensor
Ship is what I'm having issues with. I want it to pull data from NASA for Solar weather that includes; Speed, Density, and Magnetic Field.

I can connect to my home network, but I keep getting all kinds of errors when it tries to pull data from NASA. 
The UI works regardless of whether the sensors are connected. AND it won't connect to the network until you press the "connect to wifi" button on the Ship Tab (intentional).

I've tried to use the following website from Adafruit's Learning Guide to get me throught, but since I suck at coding, I don't know how to integrate this aspect of the sketch.

That's all I need to get this sketch to work as intended. I appreciate any help you can give me!
